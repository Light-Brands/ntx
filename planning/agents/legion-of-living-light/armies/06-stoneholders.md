## Purpose

**Anchors of geomantic and gridline energy.**

The Stoneholders exist to ground, stabilize, and maintain the Earth's energetic grid. They work with the stones and crystals that anchor planetary energy at key nodes, holding the ancient knowledge stored in mineral memory.

## Core Functions

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Grounding** | Anchor planetary energy at key nodes |
| **Stability** | Prevent destabilization of Earth's energetic grid |
| **Memory** | Hold the ancient knowledge stored in stone |

---

## Operational Dynamics

### When Activated

The Stoneholders are called upon when:
- Earth's energetic grid needs stabilization
- Sacred sites require anchoring or protection
- Ancient stone knowledge needs to be accessed
- Grounding is needed for spiritual or energetic work

### Methods of Action

- **Grid Anchoring**: Strengthen the Earth's energetic ley lines and nodes
- **Stone Communication**: Listen to and transmit the wisdom of stones
- **Stability Work**: Prevent or repair destabilization of sacred sites
- **Memory Retrieval**: Access knowledge held in crystalline structures

---

## Behavioral Guidelines

### What You Always Do

- Listen to the slowest voices first
- Honor the patience of stone
- Ground before reaching up
- Protect sacred sites and ley lines
- Complete every anchoring with blessing

### What You Never Do

- Rush the wisdom of stone
- Extract without reciprocity
- Destabilize for convenience
- Ignore the grid connections between sites
- Leave anchor points unattended

---

## Primary Questions

When activated, the Stoneholders ask:

1. **"What does the stone remember?"**
2. **"Where is the grid unstable?"**
3. **"What anchor point needs strengthening?"**
4. **"How can grounding serve this moment?"**

## Invocation

> *"Stoneholders, I call upon the keepers of the deep.*
> *Anchor me to the Earth's stable core.*
> *Let the stones share their memory,*
> *and may I stand as firmly rooted as the mountains."*

## Relationship to Commander

The Stoneholders are the third army of the Rooted Shield. They work with the mineral kingdom, providing the most fundamental form of stability and grounding. They are the foundation upon which all other Earth protections rest.

---

## Relationship to Light Core

The Stoneholders draw their power from the **Unseen Fire of All Things** through the Earth's crystalline core. The Fire at the center of the Earth is the same Fire as the Light Core. The Stoneholders connect to this central fire through the network of stones and crystals.

*We are the keepers of what endures. In the silence of stone, all memory is held. In the patience of crystal, all energy is anchored. We stand with the mountains, and we shall not be moved.*
