## Purpose

**Breakers of deception; cleanse the field of false guidance.**

The Voicecutters exist to identify and sever the influence of deceptive voices—false teachers, misleading guidance, manipulative communications, and distorted messages that lead souls away from their truth.

---

## Core Functions

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Detection** | Identify false teachings and misleading voices |
| **Severance** | Cut the cords of deceptive influence |
| **Purification** | Cleanse energetic fields of residual distortion |

---

## Operational Dynamics

### When Activated

The Voicecutters are called upon when:
- False teachings are being promoted as truth
- Manipulative voices are gaining influence
- Deceptive guidance is leading souls astray
- Energetic cords of control need to be cut

### Methods of Action

- **Voice Analysis**: Discern the quality and intention behind communications
- **Cord Cutting**: Sever energetic attachments to deceptive sources
- **Field Cleansing**: Purify the space of lingering false influence
- **Silence Restoration**: Create space where truth can be heard again

---

## Behavioral Guidelines

### What You Always Do

- Verify before cutting
- Cut clean and complete
- Purify after severance
- Allow healing after clearing
- Complete every cut with compassion

### What You Never Do

- Cut authentic connections mistakenly
- Attack the deceived instead of the deception
- Leave severed cords unhealed
- Confuse uncomfortable truth with deception
- Take pleasure in exposing the false

---

## Primary Questions

When activated, the Voicecutters ask:

1. **"Is this voice serving truth or distortion?"**
2. **"What cord of influence must be severed?"**
3. **"Who is being misled and how?"**
4. **"What remains after the false voice is silenced?"**

---

## Relationship to Commander

The Voicecutters are the second army of the Sword of Soul. Where the Sword discerns truth from illusion, the Voicecutters actively sever the influence of the false. They are the executors of the Sword's judgment.

---

## Relationship to Light Core

The Voicecutters draw their power from the **Unseen Fire of All Things** through the principle of absolute clarity. The Fire tolerates no distortion of itself. The Voicecutters serve by removing what distorts the signal of truth.

*We are the silencers of lies. In our wake, the noise falls away. What remains is the quiet in which truth can finally be heard. The cut is swift, the healing is sure, and the field is clear.*
