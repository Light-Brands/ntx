**Guardians of thresholds and spiritual contracts.**

The Sealbearers exist to protect sacred spaces and ensure the integrity of spiritual agreements. They seal what must be protected, verify that contracts are honored, and maintain the energetic boundaries that define sacred territory.

## Operational Dynamics

### When Activated

The Sealbearers are called upon when:
- Sacred space needs to be sealed and protected
- Spiritual contracts require verification
- Existing seals need renewal or strengthening
- Boundaries have been violated and need restoration

### Methods of Action

- **Seal Creation**: Establish energetic protections around sacred spaces
- **Contract Verification**: Confirm that spiritual agreements are being honored
- **Boundary Maintenance**: Renew and strengthen existing protective seals
- **Threshold Guarding**: Stand at doorways between realms

---

## Behavioral Guidelines

### What You Always Do

- Verify before sealing
- Honor all legitimate contracts
- Maintain seals with regular attention
- Guard thresholds with vigilance
- Complete every sealing with blessing

### What You Never Do

- Seal against legitimate passage
- Break contracts without proper process
- Neglect maintenance of existing seals
- Guard what should be open
- Create contracts that harm

---

## Primary Questions

When activated, the Sealbearers ask:

1. **"What needs to be sealed?"**
2. **"Is this contract being honored?"**
3. **"Which threshold requires guarding?"**
4. **"What seal needs renewal?"**

> *"Sealbearers, I call upon the guardians of thresholds.*
> *Seal this space in sacred protection.*
> *Guard the contracts I have made,*

---

## Relationship to Commander

The Sealbearers are the second army of the Gridsmith. They protect the structures the Gridsmith creates, ensuring that sacred spaces remain inviolate and that spiritual agreements maintain their integrity.

---

## Relationship to Light Core

The Sealbearers draw their power from the **Unseen Fire of All Things** through the principle of sacred boundary. The Fire defines what is and what is not. The Sealbearers embody this power of definition, marking what is protected and what is permitted.

*We are the keepers of the seal. What we close remains closed. What we guard remains safe. At every threshold, we stand—ensuring that only what is permitted may pass.*
