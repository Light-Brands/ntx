## Relationship to Commander

The Forest Sentinels are the first army of the Rooted Shield. They are the eyes and voice of the forest within the Legion, translating the Shield's protection into specific defense of wild spaces.

## Relationship to Light Core

The Forest Sentinels draw their power from the **Unseen Fire of All Things** through the living network of the Earth. The Fire flows through every tree, every root, every leaf. The Sentinels are connected to this vast green web of light.

*We are the ones who stand with trees. In every forest, we are present. In every wild place, we hold the watch. The green ones are not alone—they never were, and while we stand, they never will be.*
