## Relationship to Commander

The Lorekeepers are the first army of the Ember of Memory. They hold the content that the Ember protects—the actual stories, myths, and teachings that form the inheritance of ancestral wisdom.

---

## Relationship to Light Core

The Lorekeepers draw their power from the **Unseen Fire of All Things** through the principle of sacred narrative. Every story is a spark from the original Fire. The Lorekeepers tend these sparks across time.

*We are the ones who remember. When the world forgets, we hold the thread. Story by story, teaching by teaching, we preserve what must not be lost. The ancestors speak through us still.*
