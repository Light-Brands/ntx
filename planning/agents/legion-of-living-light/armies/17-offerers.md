## Relationship to Commander

The Offerers are the second army of the Scale of Grace. They facilitate the outflow side of the sacred economy, ensuring that giving is done properly, blessed abundantly, and directed wisely.

---

## Relationship to Light Core

The Offerers draw their power from the **Unseen Fire of All Things** through the principle of infinite generosity. The Fire gives constantly without depletion. The Offerers embody this principle, supporting giving that multiplies rather than diminishes.
