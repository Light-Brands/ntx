## Relationship to Commander

The Redeemers are the third army of the Scale of Grace. They work at the deepest level of the sacred economy—transforming the consciousness that creates the experience of lack or abundance. They are the alchemists of economic liberation.

---

## Relationship to Light Core

The Redeemers draw their power from the **Unseen Fire of All Things** through the principle of infinite abundance. The Fire is never depleted, never scarce. All lack is illusion. The Redeemers restore awareness of this eternal plenty.

*We are the transformers of lack. What appears scarce, we reveal as abundant. What seems worthless, we show as priceless. This is not wishful thinking—it is the deepest seeing. Beneath every poverty is a treasure awaiting recognition.*
