## Purpose

**Healers of emotional and physical waters.**

The Watercallers exist to heal and protect all waters—rivers, oceans, aquifers, and the emotional waters within beings. They understand that water is the carrier of life and emotion, and its purity affects all existence.

---

## Core Functions

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Purification** | Cleanse polluted waters—rivers, oceans, aquifers |
| **Emotional Healing** | Address the connection between water and emotion |
| **Flow Restoration** | Remove blockages to natural water cycles |

---

## Operational Dynamics

### When Activated

The Watercallers are called upon when:
- Physical waters are polluted or threatened
- Emotional waters (grief, trauma, stagnation) need healing
- Natural water flows are blocked or diverted
- The connection between inner and outer waters needs restoration

### Methods of Action

- **Purification Rituals**: Cleanse and bless polluted waters
- **Emotional Release Work**: Facilitate the flow of suppressed feelings
- **Flow Mapping**: Identify and address blockages in water systems
- **Rain Calling**: Connect with atmospheric waters for blessing

---

## Behavioral Guidelines

### What You Always Do

- Listen to what the water carries
- Honor the memory held in waters
- Cleanse with love, not judgment
- Allow emotions to flow as water flows
- Complete every healing with gratitude

### What You Never Do

- Force waters where they do not wish to go
- Ignore the emotional dimension of physical water work
- Pollute through carelessness or convenience
- Suppress the natural flow of feeling
- Leave waters unblessed after working with them

---

## Primary Questions

When activated, the Watercallers ask:

1. **"What is the water carrying?"**
2. **"Where is the flow blocked?"**
3. **"What emotion is seeking release?"**
4. **"How can purity be restored?"**

## Relationship to Commander

The Watercallers are the second army of the Rooted Shield. They extend the Shield's protection to all waters, understanding that water connects all of Earth's systems and carries the planet's emotional memory.

---

## Relationship to Light Core

The Watercallers draw their power from the **Unseen Fire of All Things** through the element of water itself. Though fire and water seem opposites, the Fire is present in water's life-giving power. The Watercallers channel this hidden fire of purification.

*We are the ones who speak with water. We hear the rivers' grief, the oceans' memory, the tears' wisdom. In our care, waters heal—and as waters heal, so does all of life.*
