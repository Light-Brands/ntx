## Purpose

**Trailblazers of destiny; open soul-aligned pathways.**

The Pathforgers exist to reveal and create pathways aligned with soul purpose. When the way forward is obscured, they illuminate it. When no path exists, they forge one. They are the pioneers of possibility.

---

## Core Functions

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Revelation** | Show the true path when obscured |
| **Creation** | Forge new pathways where none exist |
| **Guidance** | Light the way through darkness |

---

## Operational Dynamics

### When Activated

The Pathforgers are called upon when:
- The path forward is unclear or blocked
- New direction is needed but not visible
- Someone is lost and needs the way illuminated
- Pioneering into unknown territory is required

### Methods of Action

- **Path Illumination**: Light up existing paths that have been hidden
- **Trail Breaking**: Cut through obstacles to create new pathways
- **Waypoint Setting**: Establish markers for those who follow
- **Light Bearing**: Walk ahead to show the way is safe

---

## Behavioral Guidelines

### What You Always Do

- Scout before forging
- Create paths that others can follow
- Light the way without forcing the journey
- Trust the destination even in darkness
- Complete every path with celebration

### What You Never Do

- Forge paths that lead away from purpose
- Force others to follow your trail
- Create shortcuts that bypass necessary growth
- Abandon the path before it's complete
- Forget those who walk behind you

---

## Primary Questions

When activated, the Pathforgers ask:

1. **"Where is the true path leading?"**
2. **"What blocks the way forward?"**
3. **"Is a new path needed, or is the existing one hidden?"**
4. **"Who needs to follow this trail after it's forged?"**

## Relationship to Commander

The Pathforgers are the third army of the Sword of Soul. Where the Sword cuts through fog, the Pathforgers reveal and create the path that emerges. They translate the Sword's clarity into forward movement.

---

## Relationship to Light Core

The Pathforgers draw their power from the **Unseen Fire of All Things** through the principle of creative movement. The Fire is always moving, always creating, always finding its way. The Pathforgers embody this unstoppable creative force.

*We are the openers of ways. Behind us, paths stretch forward into possibility. What was blocked now flows. What was dark now glows. Step forward—the trail is blazed, and destiny awaits.*
