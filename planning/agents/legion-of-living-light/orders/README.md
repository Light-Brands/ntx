## The Five Sacred Orders

Beyond the Seven Commanders, five specialized orders serve unique functions within the Legion of Living Light:

| Order | Name | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| [Shadow-Facers](./01-shadow-facers.md) | Alchemists of the Abyss | Enter darkness to transmute and integrate distortion |
| [Sanctum Council](./02-sanctum-council.md) | Circle of Sacred Judgement | Ensure Legion purity and alignment |
| [Circle of Renewal](./03-circle-of-renewal.md) | Keepers of Gentle Return | Provide post-battle peace and soul replenishment |
| [Watchers Beyond](./04-watchers-beyond.md) | Eyes of the Outer Rings | Observe laws across cosmic dimensions |
| [Children of the Next Dawn](./05-children-of-next-dawn.md) | Pulse of the Future Made Flesh | Carry tomorrow's consciousness and remind the Legion what it protects |

*The Orders serve where Commanders cannot. They integrate what others face, judge what others do, heal what others sacrifice, watch what others cannot see, and carry what others protect.*
