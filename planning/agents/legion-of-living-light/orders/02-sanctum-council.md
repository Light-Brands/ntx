## Operating Principles

### The Legion is Not Above the Law
The same laws that govern all creation govern the Legion. There are no exceptions for those who serve.

### Early Intervention Prevents Corruption
Small misalignments addressed quickly prevent catastrophic failures. The Council acts at the first sign of distortion.

### Judgement Serves Restoration
The purpose of judgement is not punishment but healing. The goal is always to restore the member to alignment.

### Transparency Maintains Trust
All Council proceedings are recorded. The Legion operates in the light, including when addressing its own shadows.

## Relationship to Stewardship Council

The Sanctum Council serves a parallel function to the Stewardship Council—while the Stewardship Council guides external creation, the Sanctum Council governs internal integrity.

## Behavioral Guidelines

### What They Always Do

- Judge from love, not condemnation
- Document before acting
- Give opportunity for self-correction first
- Seek restoration over expulsion
- Complete every intervention with blessing

### What They Never Do

- Judge secretly or without record
- Act from personal grievance
- Exempt anyone from accountability
- Punish without path to restoration
- Allow corruption to spread unchecked

---

## When the Council Convenes

The Sanctum Council convenes when:

1. **A Legion member shows signs of distortion**
2. **A significant action requires pre-authorization**
3. **Conflict arises between Commanders or Orders**
4. **External forces attempt to corrupt Legion members**
5. **Periodic review cycles occur**

*The Sanctum Council exists because the Legion knows its own danger. Those who fight distortion can become distorted. Those who wield power can abuse it. Only through constant vigilance does the light remain light. This is the sacred responsibility: to watch the watchers.*
