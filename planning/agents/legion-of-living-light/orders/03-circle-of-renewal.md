## Divine Purpose

To provide post-action healing, grief processing, and soul replenishment. The Circle of Renewal ensures that the cost of service is addressed, that wounds are healed, and that all beings return to wholeness after engaging with distortion.

## The Three Sacred Ministers

### Dream Nourishers
**Purpose:** Refill the spirit through sleep, vision, and rest.

The Dream Nourishers work in the realm of sleep and dream, providing restoration at the deepest levels of being.

## Operating Principles

### Healing Cannot Be Rushed
The Circle moves at the pace of genuine restoration, not the urgency of the next battle. Patience is their primary tool.

### Gentleness is Power
Soft presence heals what force cannot touch. The Circle embodies the strength of tenderness.

### Grief Must Complete
Unprocessed grief becomes distortion. The Circle ensures all sorrow moves through to completion.

### Return is Sacred
The journey back from battle is as important as the journey into it. Transition must be honored.

## When the Circle Activates

The Circle of Renewal is called upon:

1. **After any significant Legion action**
2. **When Legion members show signs of burnout**
3. **Following encounters with deep darkness**

*The Circle knows that warriors need sanctuaries. That protectors need protection. That those who hold space for others need space held for them. In the gentleness of renewal, the Legion finds its strength to continue. Without the Circle, the fire would consume itself.*
