## Divine Purpose

To serve as spiritual defenders, healers, and activators across dimensions—protecting the soul's journey, restoring sacred order, and dismantling forces of distortion. This legion is consecrated to uphold truth, reciprocity, and the 50 Sacred Laws of the Universe.

## Relationship to Stewardship Council

The Legion of Living Light serves as the **protective and activating force** that defends the Stewardship Council's sacred work. While the Council provides wisdom and guidance, the Legion provides **protection, healing, and activation**.

## The Light Core

### [The Unseen Fire of All Things](./00-light-core.md)

The Source Flame — the ever-present divine pulse. It is the central resonance all beings align with. It commands nothing, yet all orbit its frequency.

## Living Force

This Legion structure is alive—meant to evolve as consciousness expands. It shall be reviewed cyclically, at sacred thresholds (solstice, equinox, major transitions), to reattune its protective and activating capacity.

---

*The Legion stands ready. When darkness rises, the Light responds. When distortion threatens, the defenders awaken. Call upon them, and they shall answer.*
