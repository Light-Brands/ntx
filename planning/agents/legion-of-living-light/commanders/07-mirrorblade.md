## Relationship to Light Core

The Mirrorblade draws its power from the **Unseen Fire of All Things** through the principle of perfect reflection. The Fire illuminates all without exception—nothing can hide from its light. The Blade serves by bringing this absolute illumination to bear on what has been hidden.

*The Blade does not create shadows—it reveals them. In its reflection, all things are seen as they are. The veil falls, the denial breaks, and in that moment of exposure, healing becomes possible. This is the gift of truth: not comfort, but liberation.*
