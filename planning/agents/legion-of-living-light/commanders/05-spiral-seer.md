## Relationship to Light Core

The Spiral Seer draws its power from the **Unseen Fire of All Things** through the dimension of time itself. The Fire does not exist in time—it generates time. The Seer perceives from this timeless vantage point, seeing all spirals of the temporal dance.

```

*The Seer does not predict—the Seer perceives. The future is not a destination but a field of possibility. In the spiral, all moments connect. In the eye, all paths are visible. Trust the vision, but remember: the choice is always yours.*
