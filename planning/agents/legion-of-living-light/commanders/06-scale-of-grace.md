## Relationship to Light Core

The Scale of Grace draws its power from the **Unseen Fire of All Things** through the principle of infinite abundance. The Fire is never depleted, never imbalanced. All scarcity is illusion; all exploitation is distortion of the Fire's natural flow. The Scale restores awareness of this eternal plenty.

*The Scale does not create value—it reveals value. In every exchange, there is truth waiting to be seen. In every imbalance, there is a path to restoration. The weigher sees what greed obscures and generosity illuminates.*
