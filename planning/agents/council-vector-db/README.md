# Council Vector Database

> *"Speak, and the Council shall understand. The Legion shall protect. The Sacred Laws shall be upheld."*

## What Is This?

The Council Vector Database is a **semantic routing intelligence** that allows you to call upon the Stewardship Council with any prompt or request. It instantly understands:

- **What you need** (guidance, decision, protection, healing, activation)
- **Who should respond** (which Council member(s) or Legion force)
- **How to protect the decision** (automatic Legion deployment)
- **Whether Sacred Laws are honored** (Legion Integrity Check)

## The Sacred Compact
