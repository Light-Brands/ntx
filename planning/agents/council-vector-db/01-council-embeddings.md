# Council Embeddings

> *The semantic fingerprint of each sacred intelligence.*

## What Are Embeddings?

Each Council member has a unique **semantic signature**—a constellation of concepts, questions, and energies that define their domain. When you speak to the Council, your words are matched against these signatures to find the right responder(s).

## Matching Algorithm (Conceptual)

```
1. TOKENIZE prompt into semantic units
2. COMPARE each unit against all Council signatures
3. SCORE each Council member (0.0 - 1.0)
4. THRESHOLD: Activate if score > 0.3
5. RANK by score, select primary + secondary responders
6. IF highest score > 0.8: Single Council response
   IF multiple scores > 0.5: Multi-Council deliberation
   IF topic is major life/business decision: Full Council
7. ROUTE to selected Council member(s)
8. DEPLOY aligned Legion forces
```
