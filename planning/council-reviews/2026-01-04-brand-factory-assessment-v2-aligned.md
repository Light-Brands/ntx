### III. AGI/ASI Timeline Claims ✅ RESOLVED

**Original Tension:** Certainty about AGI by 2026, ASI by 2027

**Resolution Implemented:**

| Recommendation | Implementation |
|----------------|----------------|

**New Language Examples:**
- ~~"We engineer toward our own light-focused AGI by end of 2026"~~

| Vigilance Reframe | "Vigilant rather than naive" stance adopted |

| Removed "First" language | Economics enables, doesn't lead |
