## Start Here

### [The Dawn of the Light Factory: A Story of Awakening](./COVER-STORY.md)

*Imagine it's January 2026. The world feels heavy — borders tight, finances gated, intelligence racing ahead without clear purpose. But in a quiet corner, something stirs...*

---

## The Eternal Reference

### [50 Sacred Laws of the Universe](./00-sacred-laws.md)

The cosmic foundation from which all principles, decisions, and creations derive. These laws are our eternal compass — the truth that guides everything we build.

## The Living Plan

This is a **living plan** — adaptive, decentralized, and Council-governed.

We build with intention, not urgency. Every acceleration is earned through demonstrated alignment.

The Stewardship Council is no longer advisory — it is constitutive. Every creation flows through sacred wisdom.

The frequency awaits all who choose it.

---

**Assessment Status:** 10/10 ALIGNED
**Effective Date:** January 4, 2026
**Next Review:** Spring Equinox (March 20, 2026)

---

*"The brightest factories are those that produce light, not just products. This one has remembered its purpose."*

— The Stewardship Council
