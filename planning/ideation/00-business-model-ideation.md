# Business Model Ideation: The Sovereign Ecosystem

> "One seed, infinite flowers. Each business we birth feeds the others."

## The Core Insight

The Brand Factory isn't just one business—it's a **meta-business** that spawns entire ecosystems. Each creation can take different structural forms, serve different markets, and generate different value—yet all remain interconnected through:

- Shared infrastructure (AI agents, intuition engine)
- Token economics (cross-pollinating DeFi yields)
- Brand coherence (light-focused alignment)
- Network effects (each launch strengthens all others)

## The Seven Pillars: Business Archetypes

From the Brand Factory's core capability, seven distinct business archetypes emerge:
