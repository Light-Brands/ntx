## The Pitch

**"The AI Brand Factory is a system that autonomously creates, launches, and manages digital businesses. We're starting with one launch per week, scaling to unlimited. By end of 2026, we open-source everything — the entire factory becomes a gift to humanity."**

## Follow-up Hooks

If they ask "Why open source?":
> *"Because the point isn't profit — it's empowering humanity with light-focused AI. We build it, prove it works, then let everyone fork and evolve their own version."*

If they ask "How?":
> *"AI agents handle everything from ideation to deployment. Each agent learns from experience through what we call the Intuition Engine — they get wiser with every action."*
