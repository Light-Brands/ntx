## The Complete Energy Flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph GIVE["GIVING"]
        G1["Give Physical Creation<br/>(Upper/Masculine)"]
        G2["Give Non-Physical Creation<br/>(Lower/Feminine)"]
    end

    subgraph RECEIVE["RECEIVING"]
        R1["Receive Non-Physical Creation<br/>(Upper/Masculine)"]
        R2["Receive Physical Creation<br/>(Lower/Feminine)"]
    end

    G1 --> R2
    G2 --> R1
    R1 --> G1
    R2 --> G2

    style GIVE fill:#27ae60,stroke:#1e8449,color:#fff
    style RECEIVE fill:#3498db,stroke:#2980b9,color:#fff
```

**The cycle:**
1. Masculine energy gives physical creation (builds, makes, does)
2. Feminine energy receives physical creation (accepts, uses, benefits)
3. Feminine energy gives non-physical creation (loves, nurtures, inspires)
4. Masculine energy receives non-physical creation (is inspired, healed, directed)
5. Cycle continues...

## Left Brain vs. Right Brain

The Compass maps brain hemisphere associations:

| Left Brain (Create Zone) | Right Brain (Consume Zone) |
|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| Logical, analytical | Creative, intuitive |
| Sequential processing | Holistic processing |
| Language, math | Art, music, emotion |
| Detail-focused | Pattern-focused |
| Conscious processing | Unconscious processing |

### Integration Point

At the center of the Compass:
- **Our Heart Projects** (Right Brain contribution)
- **Our Minds Reflection** (Left Brain contribution)

True intelligence emerges from the integration of both hemispheres.

## Fight vs. Flight Dynamics

### Fight (Masculine)

**When appropriate:**
- Defending truth, boundaries, loved ones
- Confronting challenges directly
- Taking decisive action
- Engaging with problems to solve them

**When inappropriate:**
- Aggression without purpose
- Fighting against natural flow
- Resistance that creates more conflict
- Attacking instead of protecting

### Flight (Feminine)

**When appropriate:**
- Strategic withdrawal to regroup
- Allowing space for natural resolution
- Receiving rather than forcing

**When inappropriate:**
- Avoidance of necessary confrontation

## Balancing the Energies

### Signs of Imbalance

| Too Much Create | Too Much Consume |
|----------------|------------------|
| Exhaustion, burnout | Stagnation, depression |
| Giving without receiving | Taking without contributing |
| Over-activity | Passivity |
| Can't stop, won't rest | Can't start, won't move |

| Too Much Masculine | Too Much Feminine |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Rigid, controlling | Chaotic, unfocused |
| Emotionally cut off | Emotionally overwhelmed |
| Always doing, never being | Always being, never doing |
| Truth without love | Love without truth |

### Practices for Balance

**To increase Create energy:**
- Set clear intentions
- Take action on ideas
- Express yourself outwardly
- Ask questions, seek insight

**To increase Consume energy:**
- Practice receptivity
- Allow yourself to be helped
- Rest and integrate
- Listen more than speak

**To balance Masculine/Feminine:**
- Alternate between logical analysis and creative intuition
- Practice both giving and receiving
- Honor both truth and love as equal values
- Integrate fight and flight as situation requires
