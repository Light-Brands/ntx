## The Time Axis (Horizontal)

Time flows from left to right across the Compass:

```
PAST                    PRESENT                   FUTURE
Reflection              Perception                Projection
    │                       │                         │
    │ ◄──── Time ──────────►│◄──── Time ─────────────►│
    │                       │                         │
```

### Reflection (Past)

## The State-Church Axis

The horizontal dividing line carries the labels:

```
          Logical                           Spiritual
            │                                   │
    ────────┼───────────────────────────────────┼────────
            │                                   │
          STATE                              CHURCH

         │  Consciousness emerging from unconsciousness
         │
         ▼ Falling into Consume Zone
```

### Horizontal Movement

```
Past ◄────────────────────────────────► Future

    Processing what was        Projecting what will be
    Internal dialogue          External manifestation
    Reflection                 Projection
```

### Diagonal Patterns

## Practical Navigation

### Identifying Your Quadrant

Ask yourself:

1. **Am I creating or consuming?** (Vertical position)
2. **Am I reflecting or projecting?** (Horizontal position)
3. **Is my internal dialogue positive or negative?** (Upper or Lower)
4. **Am I asking questions or making excuses?** (Consciousness level)

### Moving Through Quadrants

**From Quadrant 3 (Consume + Past) to Quadrant 2 (Create + Future):**
1. Recognize negative patterns (awareness)
2. Shift internal dialogue (transformation)
3. Ask questions instead of making excuses (activation)
4. Project intention toward truth (manifestation)

**From Quadrant 4 (Consume + Future) to Quadrant 1 (Create + Past):**
1. Receive creative inspiration
2. Integrate through reflection
3. Transform into conscious insight
4. Emerge with joy and expanded understanding

## Summary

| Quadrant | Time | Mode | Energy | Destination |
|----------|------|------|--------|-------------|
| 1 (Upper Left) | Past | Create | Conscious Reflection | Life/Joy/Love |
| 2 (Upper Right) | Future | Create | Logical Projection | Truth |
| 3 (Lower Left) | Past | Consume | Unconscious Patterns | Death/Fear/Pain |
| 4 (Lower Right) | Future | Consume | Creative Reception | Love |

The quadrants are not fixed positions but dynamic states through which consciousness flows continuously.
