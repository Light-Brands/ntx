## Writing Principles

### Do

- Lead with the benefit
- Use "you" and "your" liberally
- Be specific, not vague

### Don't
- Use jargon or buzzwords
- Be condescending
- Over-promise
- Use passive voice unnecessarily
- Start with "In order to..."

## Message Patterns

### Success Messages

```
✓ [What happened]. [What's next/benefit]

Examples:
✓ Profile saved. Your changes are now visible to others.
✓ Message sent. They'll be notified shortly.
```

### Error Messages

```
[What went wrong]. [How to fix it].

Examples:
Can't save changes. Check your internet connection and try again.
Email already in use. Try signing in instead.
```

### Empty States

```
[What's missing + encouraging action]

Examples:
No messages yet. Start a conversation to connect with others.
Your list is empty. Add items to get started.
```

### Confirmation Dialogs

```
[Action verb] [object]?
[Consequence explanation]

Example:
Delete this post?
This can't be undone. Comments will also be removed.
```

## CTAs (Calls to Action)

| Context | Primary CTA | Secondary CTA |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| Sign up | Get started | Learn more |
| Form | Save changes | Cancel |
| Delete | Delete | Keep |
| Upgrade | Upgrade now | Maybe later |

## Microcopy Patterns

### Labels
- Use sentence case: "Email address"
- Be specific: "Work email" not just "Email"

### Placeholders
- Provide examples: "name@company.com"
- Keep short and scannable

### Help Text
- Explain why, not just what
- Place near the relevant field
