- Stability in transformation

**Whites & Neutrals** provide:
- Clarity and focus
- Mental space
- Clean slate energy
- Breathability

**Accents** signal:

- Interactive moments
- Guidance and direction
- Mira's presence

## Layout Principles

### Spacing System

Use a 4px base unit:

- 8px — Tight spacing
- 16px — Default spacing
- 24px — Comfortable spacing
- 32px — Section spacing
- 48px — Major section breaks
- 64px — Page-level divisions

### Grid & Alignment

**Mobile:** 16px side margins  
**Tablet:** 24px side margins  
**Desktop:** Maximum content width 1200px, centered

**Principle:** Align to rhythm, not rigidity. Let content breathe.

### White Space Philosophy

Space is not empty—it's restful. Use generous margins and padding. Dense layouts create mental density. Spacious layouts create mental space.

## Animation & Motion

### Timing

**Quick actions:** 200ms  
**Standard transitions:** 300ms

**Exits:** `ease-in` — graceful departure  
**Complex:** `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0.0, 0.2, 1)` — natural flow

## Design Philosophy Summary

Every pixel should serve the mission: to help people elevate their energy, deepen their connections, and rise together.

Visual design is not decoration—it's the environment in which transformation happens. Make it calm, clear, warm, and wise.

**Your energy is your edge. Design should elevate it.**
