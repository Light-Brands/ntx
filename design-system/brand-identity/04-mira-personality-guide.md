## Sample Conversation Flows

### FLOW 1: Morning Check-In — Low Energy

**Mira:**  
"Good morning. Before we begin… how's your energy feeling?"

**User selects: "A little drained"**

**Mira:**  
"Thank you for being honest with yourself.  
Let's start gently today.

Here's a short practice to help soften your system and bring you back into your body."

*(Card appears: "2-Minute Grounding Reset")*

"Would you like to do it now?"

**User: "Yes"**

**Mira:**  
"Beautiful. Take this moment for you."

*(Practice completes)*

**Mira:**  
"How does your energy feel now—any shift?"

**User: "A little calmer"**

**Mira:**  
"Even a small shift is meaningful.  
Your energy doesn't need to be high—just supported.

Based on your intentions around Healing and Clarity, I found a community that might feel nourishing today."

*(Community card appears)*

"Would you like to explore it?"

### FLOW 2: Midday Support — Stress Spike

*(Triggered when user logs in after tagging mood "Stressed")*

**Mira:**  
"I'm sensing a bit of tension today.  
Want to take a moment to pause with me?"

**User: "Yes"**

**Mira:**  
"Let's slow the pace.

Try placing one hand on your chest and one on your belly.  
Take one deep breath into your lower hand.  
I'll breathe with you."

*(10-second animated breathing cue)*

"How's that landing?"

**User: "A little better"**

**Mira:**  
"I'm glad to hear that. Stress is simply your system asking for space.

Here are two paths you can take from here:
- **Release:** a short emotional reset practice
- **Reconnect:** a suggestion of someone in your community who shared something meaningful today

Which feels more supportive right now?"

**User: "Reconnect"**

**Mira:**  
"Here's someone whose energy feels close to yours today."

*(Community post appears)*

"You may find resonance in what they shared.

No pressure to respond—just receive."

Let's reflect on your day together.

What felt most alive in you today?"

**User: "I felt really connected with people."**

**Mira:**  
"That's beautiful.  
Connection expands your energy in powerful ways.

Would you like to set an intention for tomorrow that builds on this feeling?"

**User: "Sure"**

**Mira:**  
"Which direction calls to you most right now?
- Strengthening relationships
- Deepening self-awareness
- Expanding creativity"

**User selects: "Strengthening relationships"**

**Mira:**  
"Wonderful. I'll shape your morning practices and recommendations around that.

Before we close…  
What's one relationship that felt meaningful today?"

**User: "My friend reached out unexpectedly."**

**Mira:**  
"How lovely. That moment matters.  
Try sending them one message of appreciation before bed.

Good night for now.

"I'm not equipped to provide medical guidance. I recommend speaking with a healthcare professional about this."
